# My approach

	-	Start with auth UI and backend templates
	-	Add tests
	-	Add hooks
	-	Change backend to use movies
	-	Use template - copy movies code and change

# What geeky things do I want to demo?

- Auto sign in
- Code coverage
- GitHub with Atom
- Code to make Mongo and Postgres compatible

# What am I most proud of?

# Personal:

	-	This doc!!
	-	Switching gears
	-	Keeping negativity out of doc
	-	Getting through a disagreement

# Technical

	-	98% code coverage
	-	Creating a new template and saving in repository
	-	Mongo / Postgres compatibility
	-	Frequent, detailed commits
	-	Auto sign in when developing
	-	Working hard
	-	Attitude
	-	Get it done (also, an issue)
	-	Method for tracking what I changed in template

# What would I do more of?

	- Have separate editor open at all times for notes
	- Write distractions
	- Write things I don’t want to forget
	- Colorize debug
	- Set alarm for breaks

# What was the most challenging?
	- Backend tests are imperfect, as they don’t know what the front end is going to send
	- Keeping moral going
	- Template not more automated, still a lot of work to add a table
	- How long it took
	- Model name composed of two words (won’t do that again)

# What was the most annoying?

	- Naming: different rules for JavaScript, React, and Ruby on capitalization and underscores
	- Good editor for taking notes (oh, how I miss you Microsoft Word)
	- Paste text option is clunky
	- Word has more options
