- Version 1: 3 x 3 tic tac toe, single user.  Basic functionality:
  - Backend and frontend
  - 100% code coverage on backend
  - BDD/TDD on backend for features not generated by Rails
  - Create two templates first for Rails and React
  - Same features as previous project
    - Replay existing games
Stretch goals:
- Improve UI.  Maybe take UI for screen from React project, that was nice and
simple, will expand well for 3D and n-Dimensional.
- User specifies size of grid and how many in a row are needed
  - Game status, winner and winning sequence
- 3D tic tac toe.  3rd dimension displayed as separate grid
- Multi-user
- n-dimensional tic tac toe.  Will only be able to see 3 dimensions at a time,
specify coordinates of other dimensions you want to see.
