My Story

What geeky things do I want to demo?

- Auto sign in
- GitHub with Atom
- Code to make Mongo and Postgres compatible
- Code Coverage

What am I most proud of?

Personal

	-	This doc!!
	-	Switching gears, Wed night, not getting the API, thinking I had to do it, then MVP
	-	Keeping negativity out of doc
	-	Getting through a disagreement

Technical

	-	98% code coverage
	-	Creating a new template and saving in repository
	-	Mongo / Postgres compatibility
	-	Frequent, detailed commits
	-	Auto sign in when developing
	-	Working hard
	-	Attitude
	-	Get it done (also, an issue)
	-	Method for tracking what I changed in template

What was the most challenging
	•	Model name composed of two words (won’t do that again)
	•	Backend tests are imperfect, as they don’t know what the front end is going to send
	•	Keeping moral going
	•	Template not more automatic
	•	Tools ain’t what they use to be (used to do development through
	⁃	UI generators,
	⁃	WYSIWYG,
	⁃	visualization and traversal
	⁃	mass changes
	⁃	code saved as binary!! (Could get text reports)

What was the most annoying?

	•	Naming: different rules for JavaScript, React, and Ruby on capitalization and underscores
	•	Good editor for taking notes (oh, how I miss you Microsoft Word)
	•	Paste text option is clunky
	•	Word has more options


Issues to resolve

I am mixed on the below, as there are positives in the below

	•	Spending too much time on non-critical tasks
	•	Why did it take so long for basic CRUD?
	•	Being quicker
	•	Doing everything at once (when using template)
	•	Testing
	•	MVP focus

What would I do more of?

	•	Color for debugging
	•	Have separate editor open at all times for notes
	•	Write distractions
	•	Write things I don’t want to forget
	•	Colorize debug
	•	Set alarm for breaks


What would I do differently?

	•	Read instructions / lessons for template
	•	Figure out the case thing
	•	Single word entity names!
	•	Daily retro
	•	Forced breaks
	•	Schedule walks
	•	Become proficient at two templates
	•	Take break even if have not completed something
	•	Regular check ins with a buddy
	•	?? Investigate hard part first or prototype
	•	Talk with someone when things are taking too long
	•	Time tracking?
	•	Figure out how to mimic front end to backend more carefully

What is next for this project?

Project

	•	Add API or webscraping
	•	Polish UI big time / mobile
	•	Organize user stories and prioritize according to user needs, focussing investigation on
	⁃	(Epic) Query and store meetup and eventbrite events
	⁃	Check out APIs Eron sent me
	⁃	Publish to a google calendar

My approach

	•	Start with auth UI and backend templates
	•	Get them to work on same table
	•	Add backend tests
	•	Add hooks
	•	Use template - copy movies code and change
